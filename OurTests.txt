For the door directions we wanted to make sure our doors were in the right spots and weren't off by one anywhere.
The left facing door was chosen at its location because on our board it surrounded by many different cells of
varying type. This makes it a good candidate for the test. for all of our test cells we chose mainly cells that
bordered other types of cells. This way we can tell if there is an error loading the file easier because the tests
are more likely to fail. This is especially true when testing the initials of cells.
